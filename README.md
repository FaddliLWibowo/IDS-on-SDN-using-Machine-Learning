# IDS-on-SDN-using-Machine-Learnng
WORK IN PROGRESS!
PLAN:
Intrusion detection system for a software defined network using Random Forest method for  classification of flows. 
Created an application for IDS on the SDN controller (Ryu) using Python
IMPLEMENTATION SO FAR:
Created a network topology using Python. 
Created application on the RYU Controller which periodically stores the statistics of the incoming packets into a log file.
The log file can be used as training data for machine learning.
